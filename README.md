### Untested code

This is something I wrote in about five minutes using NodeJS to show one way you can derive salt of a hash if you already have the
hash and the plaintext password.

### To run
```
git clone https://github.com/TheRealNullCell/SaltCracker.git
cd SaltCracker
npm install
node index.js
```

### TODO
Make this an actual command line utility and use the nooocl library for OpenCL support.
